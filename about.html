<p>The sisterhood of Sigma Omicron Pi was established at San Francisco State University in 1930 by ten Asian American women pursuing the interest of teaching. They chose the Greek letters of Σ, Ο and Π to represent themselves as the "Sisters of Pedagogy." At the advent of World War II, the organization was forced to become inactive. Since its inception, Sigma Omicron Pi has grown in membership with student chapters at:</p>

<p>• Beta Chapter, San Francisco State University
• Gamma Chapter, San Jose State University
• Delta Chapter, University of California, Davis
• Epsilon Chapter, California State University, Sacramento
• Zeta Chapter, University of California, Santa Cruz
• Eta Chapter, University of Maryland

<p>As strong women participating in various social, academic, and community activities, we maintain our objectives of unity, friendship, leadership, and community service established over 80 years ago. 
The purpose of ΣΟΠ is to promote unity, lifelong friendships, leadership, and community service. This organization offers women a supportive network of sisters to achieve academic and social growth. The sisterhood of ΣΟΠ provides an environment where sisters may utilize and develop their organizational skills. 
</p>

<p>Each one of our sisters has different interests and aspirations, yet we all share one common ground - ΣΟΠ. We have based our sisterhood on four objectives - UNITY, FRIENDSHIP, LEADERSHIP and SERVICE. In addition, ΣΟΠ has a tradition of lifelong friendship that has prevailed for over eight decades. 
We have over 1,000 alumni sisters across the country. Be apart of our long history. Make a difference in the Asian American community and experience the sisterhood </p>
